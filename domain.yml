        **Land Selection and Preparation for Potato**:
        - Potatoes thrive in well-drained loamy or sandy loam soils with good organic matter. The ideal soil pH is between 5.5 and 6.5.
        - **Plowing**: The land needs to be plowed 3-4 times to a depth of 20-25 cm to loosen the soil and remove weeds.
        - **Leveling**: The field should be leveled for uniform water distribution.
        - **Organic Fertilizers**: Applying 8-10 tons of cow dung or compost per acre can improve fertility.
        - **Soil Treatment**: In case of high soil salinity or acidity, lime or gypsum should be applied as required.

        **Land Selection and Preparation for Sweet Potato**:
        - Sweet potatoes thrive in light, well-drained sandy loam or loamy soils rich in organic matter. The ideal pH range for growth is between 5.5 and 6.5.
        - **Plowing**: Plow the field 3-4 times to loosen the soil to a depth of 20-25 cm and remove weeds.
        - **Leveling**: Level the field to ensure even water distribution and avoid waterlogging.
        - **Raised Beds**: Prepare raised beds or ridges for better drainage and root development.
        - **Organic Fertilizers**: Apply 8-10 tons of decomposed cow dung or compost per acre during land preparation to enrich the soil.
        - **Soil Treatment**: If the soil is too acidic, lime should be applied to adjust the pH.

  utter_land_preparation_grass_pea:
    - text: |
        **Land Selection and Preparation for Grass Pea**:
        - Grass pea grows best in well-drained loamy or sandy loam soils with good organic matter content. It can tolerate drought and water stress but does not perform well in waterlogged conditions.
        - **Plowing**: The land should be plowed 2-3 times to a depth of 15-20 cm to loosen the soil and remove weeds. Fine tilth is not mandatory, as grass pea can grow on marginal soils, but proper land preparation improves yield.
        - **Leveling**: Level the field for even water distribution and to prevent waterlogging, which can cause root rot.
        - **Organic Fertilizers**: Apply 4-6 tons of decomposed cow dung or compost per acre to improve soil structure and fertility.
        - **Soil Treatment**: If the soil is too acidic, lime should be applied to adjust the pH to a desirable level (6.0-7.5). Proper drainage systems should be in place to avoid waterlogging.

  utter_land_preparation_chickpea:
    - text: |
        **Land Selection and Preparation for Chickpea**:
        - Chickpeas thrive in well-drained loamy or sandy loam soils with pH levels between 6.0 and 7.5. Avoid heavy clay soils or waterlogged fields, as chickpeas are sensitive to excessive moisture.
        - **Plowing**: Plow the field 2-3 times to a depth of 15-20 cm to break soil clods and remove weeds.
        - **Leveling**: Level the field to ensure even water distribution and prevent waterlogging.
        - **Organic Fertilizers**: Apply 5-7 tons of cow dung or compost per acre to improve soil fertility and structure.
        - **Soil Treatment**: If the soil is too acidic, lime should be applied to adjust pH levels.

        **Land Selection and Preparation for Felon Lentil**:
        - Felon lentil grows best in well-drained loamy or sandy loam soils with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. It performs well in areas with moderate moisture and no waterlogging.
        - **Plowing**: Plow the field 2-3 times to loosen the soil and remove weeds. Ensure the soil is tilled to a depth of 15-20 cm to promote root penetration.
        - **Leveling**: Level the field for even water distribution and to prevent waterlogging.
        - **Organic Fertilizers**: Apply 4-6 tons of decomposed cow dung or compost per acre to improve soil structure and fertility.
        - **Soil Treatment**: If the soil is too acidic, lime should be applied to adjust the pH to a suitable range.

        **Land Selection and Preparation for Pointed Gourd**:
        - Pointed gourd thrives in well-drained loamy or sandy loam soils with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. The field should be free of waterlogging and receive adequate sunlight.
        - **Plowing**: Plow the land 3-4 times to loosen the soil to a depth of 15-20 cm. This ensures better aeration and root penetration.
        - **Leveling**: Level the field to ensure even water distribution and prevent waterlogging.
        - **Raised Beds or Pits**: Create raised beds, ridges, or small pits to avoid waterlogging and allow proper root development.
        - **Organic Fertilizers**: Incorporate 8-10 tons of cow dung or compost per acre to enhance soil fertility.
