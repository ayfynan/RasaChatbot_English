#Entire plantation process
  utter_plantation_process_potato:
    - text: |
        "The entire process of potato plantation involves several steps: land preparation, sowing of seeds, fertilization, irrigation, weed management and etc."
        
        1. **Land Selection and Preparation**:
          - Potatoes thrive in well-drained loamy or sandy loam soils with good organic matter. The ideal soil pH is between 5.5 and 6.5.
          - **Plowing**: The land needs to be plowed 3-4 times to a depth of 20-25 cm to loosen the soil and remove weeds.
          - **Leveling**: The field should be leveled for uniform water distribution.
          - **Organic Fertilizers**: Applying 8-10 tons of cow dung or compost per acre can improve fertility.
          - **Soil Treatment**: In case of high soil salinity or acidity, lime or gypsum should be applied as required.

        2. **Seed Selection and Preparation**:
          - **Seed Type**: Certified and disease-free potato tubers are selected for planting. Popular varieties in Bangladesh include 'Diamant,' 'Granola,' 'Cardinal,' and local varieties like 'Lal Pakri' and 'Shil Bilati.'
          - **Seed Size**: Seed tubers are cut into pieces weighing around 30-50 grams each, ensuring each piece has at least two “eyes” (the growing buds).
          - **Seed Treatment**: Seed tubers are treated with fungicides like Mancozeb to prevent fungal diseases. After treatment, they are dried in a shaded area before planting.

        3. **Sowing**:
          - **Sowing Time**: Potato sowing typically begins in late October to early November, depending on weather conditions.
          - **Planting Depth**: Seeds are sown at a depth of 8-10 cm, maintaining a distance of about 20-30 cm between each tuber in rows that are 60-75 cm apart.
          - **Irrigation**: After planting, the first irrigation is done immediately to ensure proper seed germination.

        4. **Fertilization Schedule**:
          - **Balanced fertilization** is essential for good yields.
          - **Basal Fertilizers (Before Planting)**:
            - Urea: 50 kg
            - Triple Super Phosphate (TSP): 50 kg
            - Muriate of Potash (MoP): 40-50 kg
            - Gypsum: 10-15 kg
          - **Top Dressing**:
            - First application of urea (40 kg) and MoP (20 kg) at 25-30 days after planting.
            - Second top dressing (30 kg of urea) at the flowering stage.

        5. **Irrigation Schedule**:
          - Potatoes typically require 2-4 irrigations throughout the growing period, depending on the rainfall and soil moisture content.
          - In well-drained soils, more frequent but lighter irrigations may be required.
          - If irrigation systems like drip or sprinkler irrigation are used, the water efficiency can be improved, and the total water requirement may be slightly lower.

        6. **Critical Growth Stages for Irrigation**:
          - **Germination Stage**: This is right after planting. The first irrigation is provided to ensure proper seed germination.
            - Water Requirement: 40-60 mm of water per hectare.
          - **Tuber Initiation (30-40 days after planting)**: Potatoes are most sensitive to moisture stress during this stage. Irrigation is critical to support proper tuber formation.
            - Water Requirement: 70-100 mm of water per hectare.
          - **Tuber Bulking (60-90 days after planting)**: During this stage, the potato tubers grow rapidly. Adequate moisture is essential to ensure a high yield and good tuber quality.
            - Water Requirement: 80-120 mm of water per hectare.
          - **Maturity (90-120 days after planting)**: Toward the end of the growing season, water needs decrease. Over-irrigation at this stage can lead to rotting.
            - Water Requirement: 40-60 mm of water per hectare.

        7. **Weed Management**:
          - Weeds must be controlled to avoid competition for nutrients and light.
          - **Manual Weeding**: Perform the first weeding 15-20 days after planting, followed by another at 40-45 days.
          - **Mulching**: Use organic mulches like straw to retain soil moisture and suppress weeds.

            **Seed Selection and Preparation**
            - **Seed Type**: Pointed gourd is typically propagated through vine cuttings or rooted plants, as it rarely produces viable seeds.
            - **Vine Selection**: Use healthy vine cuttings, each about 20-25 cm long, with at least 3-4 nodes for effective rooting.
            - **Vine Treatment**: Allow the vine cuttings to dry in a shaded area for a few hours before planting to prevent rotting and promote strong root development.
            - **Planting Time**: The ideal planting time is between February and March, when the weather conditions are favorable for vine growth.
            - **Spacing**: Maintain 1.5-2 meters between rows and 1 meter between plants within each row to allow sufficient space for the vines to spread.
            - **Support Structure**: Set up bamboo poles, ropes, or nets to create trellises for the climbing vines. This structure improves air circulation, supports the plant, and makes maintenance easier.
